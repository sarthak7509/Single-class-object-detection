# Single Class Object Detection
## Breif Introduction
This repository depicts the basics of single class object detection and also shows the manual implementation of the Bounding box regression this repo is the previous implementation of the [Dog-Breed-Analysis](https://github.com/sarthak7509/Dog_breed_analysis).

## How to run this repository.
To run this repo follow the below steps.<br>
1. Clone this repo using below code
```
git clone https://github.com/sarthak7509/Single-class-object-detection.git
```
2. Install the dependencies in the requirement.txt file using CMD.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```
3. Run the predict.py file for quick demonstration following with the path of the image using -i. You can also pass the text file with all the path of the images to fast forward the method.
```python
python predict.py -i --path-to-image-file--
```
